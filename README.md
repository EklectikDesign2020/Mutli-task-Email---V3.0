# Multi-Task-Email <MTE> .
Still working on name. Designed and coded by Eklectik Design a one man team with a powerful tool Google, and his mind.

# Package used.
Existing package in python : Tkinter, os, time, csv and non existing are PIL. How to install:
Open a terminal.
```
pip install pillow
```
If you do not have "pip" please follow this instruction and how to install [PIP](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-windows).

# Description.
The main function of this program is it can send emails using .csv database file. The .csv must have a header 'Email' so if you are using a personal made .csv file please make sure it does have the some orthograph under the email columns. It uses smtp.live.com and smtp.gmail.com, you will have to chose depending on your provider. An extra step for Gmail user, please see below under config Gmail account.

# How to use.
It will ask you to enter your email address and password, then tick the correct provider and browser to your .csv. In the Message do not delete the 'Subject text but input  your subject, newline and type the message. Further update will allow you to insert attachments.

# Config Gmail account
Log in to your account, once done click on your profile icon top right corner and click on 'Manage your account', on the left side you will see 'security', then search for 'less secure access' 'ENABLE'. I don't recommend doing this with your personal E-mail.
